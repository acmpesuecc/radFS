WEEK 1 Bhuvigna's Progress

1. Read articles on filesystems and tried to get a basic understanding of the linux filesystem hierarchy .
2. Learnt about open-source licenses and decided which one will suit our project the best and added the license to the repo.
3. Studied the complete workflow of FUSE to understand how user-space filesystems interact with the kernel.
4. A little bit of reading about in-memory ramFS and tmpFS .

WEEK 2 plans 
1. LEARN GO (I'm kinda lagging behind on this)
2. Work on a basic in-memory filesystem in FUSE, referring to ramFS and tmpFS.
3. Try implementing FUSE filesystem using GO
4. Make a clear and well structure PPT T_T and deliver the content better in weekly review.
