# radFS
radFS is a memory-efficient filesystem built with FUSE and Go, designed with a focus on space efficiency over raw performance. It uses Adaptive Radix Trees (ART) as its primary storage data structure to minimize worst-case memory consumption while benefiting from the safety, simplicity, and flexibility of userspace filesystem development.
